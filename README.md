## Conway's Game of Life v2
### How to use:
- In any shell environment, navigate to the repository directory and run the 'run' file with `./run`

### Dependencies:
- SFML
### This is my implementation of Dr. Conways 0 player game "Game of Life"
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life
### This implementation is writtin in C++ using the SFML 2d graphics library.
- https://www.sfml-dev.org/

This implementation is currently buildable in any Linux environment with GCC Or G++ as well as the SFML libraries installed and linked.
I am planning on adding simple windows support with CMAKE in the near future, as well as UI and runtime variables for the user to play with, instead of needing to edit the source code.
The code is self explanatory, and there is an option to create your own starting bitmap for the generator to use.

Enjoy
